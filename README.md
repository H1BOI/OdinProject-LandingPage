A responsive **landing page project** built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundations course.  
This page is themed around **Forsen**, a popular Twitch streamer, and demonstrates **HTML + CSS fundamentals**, layout design, and responsive styling.

This repo helps me brush up on HTML and CSS skills while also having a little bit of fun :D
